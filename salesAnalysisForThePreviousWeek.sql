-- Write an SQL query to retrieve the total number of sales and total amount for each category
--  for the previous week. The term "previous week" refers to the time period that begins on 
--  the Monday immediately preceding the current week and ends on the following Sunday. 
--  This time period is considered to be the last complete week that has passed.

-- Database Schema:

-- categories:

-- category_id (integer, primary key) - Unique identifier for the category.
-- category_name (varchar) - Name of the category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).

-- products:

-- product_id (integer, primary key) - Unique identifier for the product.
-- category_id (integer, foreign key) - References the category_id in the categories table.
-- product_name (varchar) - Name of the product.

-- sales:

-- sale_id (integer, primary key) - Unique identifier for the sale.
-- product_id (integer, foreign key) - References the product_id in the products table.
-- sale_date (date) - The date when the sale occurred.
-- amount (integer) - The amount of the sale in currency.

-- Resultant Dataset:

-- category_name (text) - Name of the category.
-- total_products_sold (integer) - Count of sales within the previous week for the given category.
-- total_sales_amount (integer) - Total amount of sales within the previous week for the given category.
-- The results should be ordered by the count of sales in descending order, then by the total amount in 
-- descending order, and finally by the category name in ascending order.
